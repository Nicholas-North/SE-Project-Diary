List of edits/additions that'll be need to made to the codebase:

1.Creation of new function called CaptureFixture.copyouterr(), that will properly maintain the stdoutt stream of text rather than delete it
  This will entail reviewing it's companion function CaptureFixture.readouterr(...); and mimic'ing it's functionality but getting rid of the destructive input thread portion
2. Implementing this as an option in all classes that have a readouterr function
3. Creation of a test to gauge proper functionality
4. Coming up with a unit test for the copyouterr() function
5. Following the guidelines of pytest to create an integration test for my update, and ensuring there's no missed dependecies or other hiccups.
